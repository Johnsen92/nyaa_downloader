# Nyaa.si Download all button
The script adds a button "Download all" next to the top right nav bar which on-click emulates
a mouse click on all magnet links appearing in the search results on this searchpage. This
enables the user to open multiple torrents at once instead of clicking on every link individually.

# Use-case
The user wants to download e.g. all episodes of a single anime. So he would refine his search
parameters to ultimately only having all the episodes of the desired anime from one fansubber group with one resolution
in his search results and then clicks "Download all" to import all at once into his torrent client.

E.g. for search parameters: Category = Anime - English-translated, Search = "Kimetsu no Yaiba horrible 1080" and then click 
on "Download all" to download the entire anime at once.

# Requirements
The script requires you to have a torrent client installed that can open magnet links and is configured to do so if you click on 
a magnet link in the browser (which is usually the case by default). I have only tested it with Tixati torrent client, but in
theory it should work with every client.
